		<h1>Blue-Maned_Hawk</h1>
		<p>
		Hi.  I'm Blue-Maned_Hawk, and this is my webpage.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm an amateur (by which I mean it's not my job) programmer, mostly working in C.  I sometimes write stuff and make other things, too.
		</p>
		<p>
		I've generally been described as a nuisance (or something else unpleasant) by multiple people.  (That's not self-deprecating humor—this has genuinely happened.  Take it as a warning.)
		</p>
		<p>
		I have committed terrible sins that I deeply regret.  I will not disclose what they are.  Be patient—they will be revealed in due time.
		<p>
		In my spare time, I fear the current state of humanity and what we will become in the concerningly near future.
		</p>
