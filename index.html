		<h1>Blue-Maned_Hawk</h1>
		<p>
		Hi.  I'm Blue-Maned_Hawk, and this is my webpage.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm an amateur (by which i mean it's not my job) programmer, mostly working in C.  I sometimes write stuff and make other things, too.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm generally an analytical person, and i try to use rationality and reasoning when i can.  I tend to be slow, thoughtful, and methodical when i work on things—or at least, that's how i'd like to view myself.  I'm an optimistic nihilist, from which i extrapolate all my other viewpoints on the world.
		</p>
		<p>
		As a warning:  Sometimes i can't be trusted.  I've done some pretty terrible things, so you may not want to associate with me—or maybe that'll make you want to associate with me more.  I dunno.  Maybe you're weird.
		</p>
		<p>
		In my spare time, i fear the current state of humanity and what we will become in the concerningly near future.
