		<h1>The Best @!&#?*$ Copy-Left License Ever</h1>
		<a class=back href=../index.html>← back to the main page</a>
		<p>
		I couldn't find a license that fit all of my needs, so i decided to create my own.  It's available below, or you can download a text file <a href=./BFCLLE.txt>here</a>.

		<p>
		Here's the rationale for everything.  This is not a part of the license.
		<ul>
			<li>The license is intentionally very short.  This makes it as easy to understand as possible, and also means that violators have far less of an excuse for not reading it.  It also means that no "boilerplate" version of the license is necessary, because the license can serve as its own boilerplate.</li>
			<li>The rights granted are the <a href=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en#four-freedoms>four freedoms</a>.  These are defended elsewhere, so i'm not going to bother rearticulating them here.</li>
			<li>The attribution clause is there to ensure that a person cannot claim a work as their own and benefit from it without putting effort into constructing a derived work.</li>
			<li>The no-condonement clause, the no-warranty clause, and the disclaimer of liability are there to protect the author.  They also makes it easier for someone to construct derived works, because they won't be forced to take on those responsibilities.</li>
			<li>The distribution-of-license clause ensures that everyone who recieves a copy of the work will know about the freedoms they have with the work.  It does <i>not</i> restrict sale of the work!  Doing so is the wrong way to take down capitalism, and harms the poor more than the rich.</li>
			<li>The requirement to distribute "the form of the work most optimal for modification" is, essentially, the open-source part of open-source software and open-source hardware.  This makes it as easy as possible for others to freely construct derived works.</li>
			<li>The copyleft clause ensures that if somebody makes a derived work, their changes can be incorporated back into the original work.</li>
			<li>The restriction against patent and trademark rights is because patents are a whole other ball of wax that is outside the scope of this license, and trademark rights are a really &amp;@?%$*# important think to preserve the basic right of personhood to construct and keep an identity.</li>
			<li>Many of these things have a "clearly and conspicuously" attached to them.  This is to prevent someone from trying to hide these rights from people.</li>
			<li>The hyphen in the name is solely to make the acronym, the BFCLLE, look nicer.</li>
		</ul>
		</p><p>
		This license is licensed under itself, because it's licensed under <a href=../Copyright.html>the same license as the rest of the site</a>, which is this license.
