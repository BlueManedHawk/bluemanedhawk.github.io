		<p>
		Hi.  I'm Blue-Maned_Hawk, and this is my website.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm an amateur (by which i mean it's not my job) programmer.  I mostly work with C.  I've also written a few essays on various topics.
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm generally an analytical person, and i try to use rationality and reasoning when i can.  I tend to be slow, thoughtful, and methodical when i work on things—or at least, that's how i'd like to view myself.  I'm an optimistic nihilist, from which i extrapolate all my other viewpoints on the world.
		</p>
		<p>
		Be warned that i sometimes can't be trusted, though i try to make sure this only happens when it really needs to.  I've done some terrible things, so you may not want to associate with me—or maybe that will make you want to associate with me more.
		</p>
		<p>
		In my spare time, i fear the current state of humanity and what we will become in the concerningly near future.
		</p>
