		Alternatively, you could try some of these pages:
		<ul>
			<li><a href=./index.html>Main Page</a></li>
			<li><a href=./Creations/index.html>Creations</a></li>
			<li><a href=./Contact.html>Contact</a></li>
			<li><a href=./Copyright.html>Copyright</a></p></li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 50%">
		The text of this page should be centered, but i couldn't figure out how to do it without using some bloaty crap like Fleshbox.  If you happen to know (and have tested it with Inspect Element), do feel free to get in touch.
