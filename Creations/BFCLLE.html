		<h1>The Best Fucking Copy-Left License Ever</h1>
		<p>
		I couldn't find a license that fit all of my needs, so i decided to create my own.  It's available below, or you can download a text file <a href=./BFCLLE.txt>here</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		Let me explain the reasons for everything here.
		</p><p>
		The license is intentionally very short.  This makes it as easy to understand as possible.
		</p><p>
		The rights granted are the <a href=https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.en#four-freedoms>four freedoms</a>.  These are defended elsewhere, so i'm not going to bother rearticulating them here.
		</p><p>
		The attribution clause is there to ensure that a person cannot claim a work as their own and benefit from it without putting effort into constructing a derived work.
		</p><p>
		The no-condonement clause, the no-warranty clause, and the disclaimer of liability are there to protect the author.  They also makes it easier for someone to construct derived works, because they won't need to worry about those things.
		</p><p>
		The distribution-of-license clause ensures that everyone who recieves a copy of the work will know about the freedoms they have with the work.  It does <i>not</i> restrict sale of the work!  Doing so is the wrong way to take down capitalism, and harms the poor more than the rich.
		</p><p>
		The requirement to distribute the information necessary to reconstruct the work is, essentially, the open-source part of open-source software and open-source hardware.  This makes it as easy as possible for others to freely construct derived works.
		</p><p>
		The copyleft clause ensures that if somebody makes a derived work, their changes can be incorporated back into the original work and can't be kept to themself.
		</p><p>
		The restriction against patent and trademark rights is because patents are a whole other ball of wax that is outside the scope of this license, and trademark rights are a really fucking important think to preserve the human right to construct and keep an identity.
		</p><p>
		Many of these things have a "clearly and conspicuously" attached to them.  This is to prevent someone from trying to hide these rights from people.
		</p><p>
