		<h1>Contact Me</h1>
		<p>
		Here are all of the places you can find me, in decreasing order of importance.  I'd like to also be in some other places, but i'm not because i haven't the motivation and, on occasion, i can't afford it.
		<ul>
			<li>Github:  <a href=https://github.com/bluemanedhawk><code>BlueManedHawk</code></a></li>
			<li>Tumblr:  <a href=https://bluemanedhawk.tumblr.com><code>bluemanedhawk</code></a>, the main place i blabber.</li>
			<li>Discord:  <code>BlueManedHawk#6218</code>, though i guess that's not super useful if you don't happen to be in any server that i'm in, especially since i've been kicked from a lot of the public ones that i've ever joined.</li>
			<li>YouTube:  <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJSpMgWOWLcrH5s4xT16uA><code>Blue-Maned_Hawk</code></a>.  There really isn't that much there, and none of it's worthwhile.</li>
			<li>Bay 12 Forums:  <a href=http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?action=profile;u=127708><code>BlueManedHawk</code></a></li>
			<li>Dwarf Fortress Wiki:  <a href=https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/User:BlueManedHawk><code>BlueManedHawk</code></a></li>
			<li>TruttleCities:  <a href=http://truttle1.xyz/truttlecities/~BlueManedHawk/><code>BlueManedHawk</code></a>, though now that that service is indefinitely offline, that doesn't really matter.</li>
