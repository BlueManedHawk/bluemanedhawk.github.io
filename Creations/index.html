		<h1>Blue-Maned_Hawk's Creations</h1>
		<p>
		Here's some of the things I've made.
		</p>
		<h2 class=warning>Warning</h2>
		<p class=warning>
		These are not big, professional projects.  These are mostly just silly little things I've made for my own enjoyment and for the enjoyment of whoever may stumble accross them.  Don't expect the same level of quality that you'd see in a professional project.
		</p>
		<h2>Software</h2>
		<p><ul>
			<li><a href=https://github.com/BlueManedHawk/Gake>Gake</a>—an open-source recreation of Google Snake, with some extensions and an API.</li>
			<li><a href=https://github.com/BlueManedHawk/eisyforem>eisyforem</a>—a fork of jdh's Minecraft clone.</li>
			<li><a href=https://github.com/BlueManedHawk/WinPos-Tech-Demo>WinPos Tech Demo</a>—a silly little gimmick I made a while back.</li>
		</ul></p>
		<h2>Written works</h2>
		<p>
		These are available to read online, or you can download PDFs.  Order is "latest first".
		</p>
		<p><ul>
			<li><a href=./Unicode_Stinks.html>Unicode Stinks</a> (<a href=./Unicode_Stinks.pdf>PDF</a>)—an essay about the flaws in something universal, and how to replace it.</li>
			<li><a href=./A_Conversation_with_the_Imagination.pdf>A Conversation with the Imagination</a> (<a href=./A_Conversation_with_the_Imagination.pdf>PDF</a>)—a bizarre piece of autometaseminonfictional prose that I wrote in a fit of insanity.  Only available as a PDF until I can figure out a way to format it properly in HTML.  <b>Please do not enjoy this work.</b></li>
			<li><a href=./Minecraft_is_a_Terrible_Game.html>Minecraft is a Terrible Game</a> (<a href=./Minecraft_is_a_Terrible_Game.pdf>PDF</a>)—an essay on the numerous flaws of a game that does not deserve its popularity.</li>
			<li><a href=./The_Perfect_Language.html>The Perfect Language</a> (<a href=./The_Perfect_Language.pdf>PDF</a>)—an essay on how to (theoretically!) construct a perfect language. <b>NOTE</b>:  This essay is old, and no longer reflects what I actually think about this matter.  I have changed my views, and I intend to revise this essay at some point.</li>
